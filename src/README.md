# React Component Guide line

- Write in ES6 (It's simpler, cleaner and functional)
- Write props types and default props types (Help understanding what's going on)
- Consider using children when you need to render other components
- use "var {a, b, c} = this.props" statement to avoid writing this.props everywhere
