vendor directory
=================================================
This directory contains libraries/modules from third party.
Some of them are just libraries directly downloaded from a website.
However, we also use modules from NPM and those need to be preprocessed by webpack.

`bundle.js` is the file that are generated by webpack.
If there is no `bundle.js` or if you want you want to add/edit node_modules, the following steps will be needed.
1. download modules by `npm install`, this should download all modules written in package.json
2. Edit bundle_exec.js, so that it includes node modules and make them available under WFUIJS namespace
3. run `webpack` to generate bundle.js
